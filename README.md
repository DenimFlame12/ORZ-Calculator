# ORZ-Calculator
I made an orz calculator as this is my first development project.

## Operations

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `+` | Addition |
| `-` | Subtraction |
| `*` | Multiplication |
| `/` | Division |
| `±` | Toggle sign (negates the current number that is it multiplies by -1) |
| `%` | Percentage (divide current number by 100) |
| `C` | Clear => resets everything to 0 |
| `=` | Equals => performs the calculation |

## Usage Note

**After clicking an operator** (+, -, *, /), the display does not go blank rather it keeps showing the number you entered. You need to **click digits** to enter the second number, the display will then show the new number as you type, and pressing `=` (or another operator) will compute the result.
